# 3. What do you do with your classmates after classes?

　　Apparently, I love socializing with my fellows; we usually go different kind of place to unwind ourselves from the heavy workload. However, if we are going to have a quiz on the next day, we probably will go to a coffee shop or library to pull out all the stops for the test.

　　很明显，我喜欢与人交际。我们经常去各种地方让自己从很大的工作量中放松。但如果我们第二天有考试，我们可能就会去咖啡厅或图书馆全力以赴准备考试。

# 5. Do you think your subject will be useful in the future?

　　Well, I really doubt that. You know, most of the theories or definitions that I learned in my university, just a kind of theoretical stuff. Well, lots of the examples in the textbook are actually designed or designated for ideal or typical circumstances. I think it’s out dated and not applicable to the real world situations.
　　我真的不确定。大多数我们在学校里学的理论或定义就只是一种理论上的东西。课本上的例子也都是经过设计或假定在某种理想或特定状况下发生的。我觉得这些都过时了而且在现实世界不适用。

# 6. Are you looking forward to working?

　　Absolutely. I’m really looking forward to work. At least that means you're doing something rather than just sitting there. Oh yeah, you make money too. Nobody pays you to study though it may come in handy later on. You learn a lot of things which are out of the text-book.

# 7. Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?

　　I always start promptly at eight in the mornings. I study for two hours, have a ten-minute break, and the study for another two hours. I follow this habit from Monday’s to Friday’s, but over the weekends I put in more hours. For example, I study in the afternoons as well, and then take the evenings off to relax with my family or friends.

# 8. Where do you study?

　　I’m studying in Beijing University. My university has a good reputation in China and it’s quite hard to get in. So, I’ve buckled down to my studies and managed to get through all the exams a year before. Well, fortunately, I finally got in my ideal university with my favourite major.

　　我在北京大学读书。我的大学在中国有很好的声誉且很难考入。所以我一年前就开始很认真的对待学习，通过了所有考试。幸运的是，我最终进入了我梦想的大学读自己最爱的专业。
