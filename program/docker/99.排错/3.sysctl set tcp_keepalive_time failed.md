sysctl set tcp_keepalive_time failed · Issue #8103 · moby/moby https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/8103

hi，when execute sysctl in container with privileged mode，I get this error，

root@ebcbff13e4a1:/# sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=1800
sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time: No such file or directory
is there any way to change net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time？

container is based on ubuntu latest，docker running at host ubuntu14.04.

This is a duplicate of #4717.

`Containers are limited to not allow such changes to be made for security reasons`. Mechanisms to make such changes for container level sysctl tunables are discussed in #4717.

Please take a look at #4717 and follow that discussion. I'll lock this so we can keep track of that discussion in one place.
