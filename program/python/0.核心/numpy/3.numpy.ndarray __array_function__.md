python 3.x - AttributeError: type object 'numpy.ndarray' has no attribute '__array_function__' - Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54176610/attributeerror-type-object-numpy-ndarray-has-no-attribute-array-function?r=SearchResults

I upgraded numpy to the latest version and now I am getting following error on importing numpy:

AttributeError: type object 'numpy.ndarray' has no attribute 'array_function'

I am using numpy version 1.16.


Uninstall all installs of Numpy using

pip uninstall numpy
for python3

pip3 uninstall numpy
You may need to run it twice as two versions of numpy may be installed Then run

pip install numpy

The problem
As described in the issue, the problem is caused by path conflicts between the files of different Numpy versions. They also suggest that there may be an issue with older versions of pip (specifically, there used to be an issue with how pip uninstalled (or failed to uninstall) old versions of Numpy).

The fix
The Numpy dev recommend fix is to first upgrade your pip:

## pip install -U pip
then uninstall/reinstall the latest version of Numpy (this does both in a single command):

pip install -U numpy
If that doesn't work
Some people ended up having stranger path conflicts that they were unable to resolve just by reinstalling with pip. If the above steps fail, check to see if you have any old installs of Numpy anywhere on your filesystem. If you do, get rid of them and then try reinstalling Numpy again.
