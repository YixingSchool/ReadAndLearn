NETFLIX ZUUL VS NGINX PERFORMANCE
POSTED BY STANISLAV MIKLIK | APRIL 16, 2015 | SPRING
Nowadays you can hear lot about microservices. Spring Boot is an excellent choice for building single microservice but you need to interconnect them somehow. That‚Äôs what Spring Cloud tries to solve (among other things) ‚Äì especially Spring Cloud Netflix. It provides various components e.g. Eureka discovery service together with client side load balancer Ribbon for inter-microservice communication. But if you want to communicate to outside world (you provide external API or you just use AJAX from your page heavily) it is good to hide your various services behind a proxy.

Natural choice would be Nginx. But Netflix comes with its own solution ‚Äì intelligent router Zuul. It comes with lot of interesting features and can be used e.g. for authentication, service migration, load shedding and various dynamic routing options. And it is written in Java. If Netflix uses it, is it fast enough compared to native reverse proxy? Or is it just suitable as an companion to Nginx when flexibility (or other features) are important?

Disclaimer: Do not consider this as a serious benchmark. I just wanted to get feeling how Nginx and Zuul compares and I can‚Äôt find any benchmarks on internet (ok, maybe I was not searching long enough but I wanted get my hands dirty). It does not follow any recommended benchmarking methodology (warmup period, number of measurements,‚Ä¶) and I was just using 3 micro EC2 instances (that is not optimal neither) in different availability zones.

TEST
So what have I done? Test was to compare raw performance of both solutions without any special features. I just concurrently make single HTTP request to get one HTML page (of size cca. 26KB). I used ApacheBench to make the test with 200 concurrent threads (I have tried also httperf but it looks that it was more CPU demanding so I got lower numbers then with ab).

DIRECT CONNECTION
First I was interested what is the performance of target HTTP server (once again Nginx) without any reverse proxy. Ab was running on one machine and was accessing target server directly.

Quiet nice, few more tests shows similar values: 2928 ; 2725 ; 2834 ; 2648 req/s. There are some deviations but this number is not that important now.

VIA NGINX
So now I could setup proxy server (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) with default nginx installation. I just updated configuration to proxy to target server like:

1
server {
2
   listen 80 default_server;
3
   listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;
4
 
5
   # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
6
   server_name localhost;
7
 
8
   # allow file upload
9
   client_max_body_size 10M;
10
 
11
   location / {
12
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
13
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
14
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
15
      proxy_pass http://target:80;
16
   }
17
}
And run similar test as before

Further results were 954 ; 953 ; 941 req/s. Performance and latency is (as expected) worse.

VIA ZUUL
Now we can use same machine to setup the zuul. Application itself is very simple:

1
@SpringBootApplication
2
@Controller
3
@EnableZuulProxy
4
public class DemoApplication {
5
  public static void main(String[] args) {
6
    new SpringApplicationBuilder(DemoApplication.class).web(true).run(args);
7
  }
8
}
And we just have to define fixed route in application.yml

1
zuul:
2
  routes:
3
    sodik:
4
      path: /sodik/**
5
      url: http://target
And now let‚Äôs try to run test.

Result is worse then my (optimistic?) guess. Additionally we can see two failures (and we can see two corresponding exceptions in Zuul log that complains about HTTP pool timeout). Apparently the timeout is set to 10 seconds by default.

So let‚Äôs get some more results.

Wow, what an improvement. Only what comes to my mind that Java JIT compilation could help the performance. But to verify if it was just an coincidence, one more attempt: 1010 req/sec. At the end the result is a positive surprise for me.

CONCLUSION
Zuul‚Äôs raw performance is very comparative to Nginx ‚Äì in fact after startup warmup period it is even slightly better in my results (again ‚Äì see disclaimer ‚Äì this is not a serious performance test). Nginx shows more predicable performance (lower variation) and (sadly) we have experienced minor glitches (2 out of 150000 requests) during Zuul ‚Äúwarmup‚Äù (but your microservices are fault resilient, right? üôÇ )

So if you consider using some of the extra Zuul features or want to gain more from integration with other Netflix services like Eureka for service discovery, Zuul looks very promising as a replacement for ordinary reverse proxy. Maybe it is really used by Netflix üôÇ so you can try it too.
