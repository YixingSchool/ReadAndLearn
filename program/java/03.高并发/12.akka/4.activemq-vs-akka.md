ActiveMQ software product that implements a queuing system. It implements a publish/subscribe paradigm. Processes can publish messages to queues and topics and subscribers receive them asynchronously. With queuing systems you decouple parts of your application, allow for asynchronous communication, implement message broadcasting and ensure message delivery.
Akka is a programming framework for the JVM (supports Java and Scala) focused on building concurrent processing in a distributed topology. With Akka you can break a job into pieces and dispatch those pieces to a horde of workers deployed on a network of computers. Each worker would do his part, and when done, pass the result back to a special process that puts all results together. Akka has fail over support, so If a worker fails, the system recovers.
So they are completely different things for completely different purposes.
