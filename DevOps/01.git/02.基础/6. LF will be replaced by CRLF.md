Git提交时提示'The file will have its original line endings in your working directory'
Git出现错误
git add -A
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in database/migrations/2017_07_04_10041
 

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in xxxxx

The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

之前一直没在意，趁有空着手解决，原来是Git默认配置替换回车换行成统一的CRLF，我们只需要修改配置禁用该功能即可。

Gitshell中输入如下命令解决：

git config --global core.autocrlf false
