+title:book -description:cat
### 2.用括号来组合多个词，如下面的查询：
title:(crime punishment)
### 3. Intersection
The ampersand "&" joins two patterns in a way that both of them have to match. For string "aaabbb":

aaa.+&.+bbb     # match
aaa&bbb         # no match
Using this feature usually means that you should rewrite your regular expression.

Enabled with the INTERSECTION or ALL flags.
### 4. Any string
The at sign "@" matches any string in its entirety. This could be combined with the intersection and complement above to express “everything except”. For instance:
@&~(foo.+)      # anything except string beginning with "foo"
