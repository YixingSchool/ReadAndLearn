Cloud Native Landscape Project

The CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain(没有涉足的地带) of cloud native technologies. This attempts to categorize many of the most popular projects and product offerings in the cloud native space. It is under development by CNCF with assistance from Redpoint and Amplify. There are many routes to deploying a cloud native application, with CNCF Projects representing a particularly well-traveled path(事先规划好的、别人都走过的道路).

CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project引领你进入云原生这一未经涉足的领域。目标是，在云原生范围内，将最受欢迎的项目和产品分享出来。在Redpoint 和 Amplify的规划下，CNCF设计出这个蓝图。虽然说，部署云原生应用，有多种途径，而 CNCF 项目代表着云原生的最佳实践。

Use this guide as a map to lead you through uncharted lands again and again.
利用本书提供的方法为指南，不断引导你到未经测量的领土

Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Please keep in mind these considerations:

* We generally will only list a company in one box, to represent its major or best known offering. We occasionally make exceptions for large companies.
* Projects with at least 250 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included.
* We are unlikely to create a new category for products/projects as we'd rather find the best home with the current options.
* We are generally not including commercial versions of open source software, when that version just includes minor tweaks.
* Closed source products need to link to a clear description of your product; no stealth mode companies.
* Your project or company needs a logo and the logo needs to include the name.
