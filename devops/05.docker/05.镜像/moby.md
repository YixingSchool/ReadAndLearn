17.03.0-ce (2017-03-01)

IMPORTANT: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
 new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
 Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
 release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
 initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
 there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
 Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.
