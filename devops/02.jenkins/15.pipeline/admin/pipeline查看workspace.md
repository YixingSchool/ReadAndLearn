Jenkins Pipeline Builds: Viewing Workspace in the UI - Stack Overflow

You can see your work space in three simple steps:

First, go to the build run you are interested in and click “pipeline steps”.
Then click “allocate node: start”. If you have multiple nodes, you’ll need to do this more than once.
Then you click the workspace link. (it appears on the left pane).
